# [Code-Quiz] (https://lbernadel.github.io/Code-Quiz/)

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a timer-based JavaScript coding assessment. The application has a few multiple choice questions and stores high scores on the user's device. The number of questions decides the length of time for the quiz (15 seconds/question) once the user clicks "Start" and they are penalized if they answer a question incorrectly. The final score is based on the amount remaining on the timer.

Relevant new subject matter from the week: DOM traversal, Local Storage,

## Challenges
This entire activity was very difficult. I really don't understand what I'm doing with the DOM and Local storage and it took forever just to figure out how to get my timer working. I don't understand how to display the questions individually or if I did the JSON parse correctly, so I couldn't move forward afterwards. I tried looking at online sources and class examples multiple times and was still confused after 2 days with several hours of the same cycle.
